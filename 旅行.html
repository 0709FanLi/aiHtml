          </p>

          <h4>2. Use License</h4>
          <p>
            Subject to your compliance with these Terms, TripWeaver grants you a
            limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to
            access and use the Services for personal, non-commercial purposes.
            This license does not include: (a) any resale or commercial use of

            complete information during the registration process and to update
            such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete. You are
            solely responsible for safeguarding your password and for all
            activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify

          <p>
            TripWeaver provides AI-generated travel itineraries and planning
            services ("Travel Content"). While we strive to provide accurate and
            useful information, we do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness,
            reliability, or usefulness of any Travel Content. Travel Content is
            provided for general informational purposes only and should not be
            relied upon as the sole basis for travel decisions. You acknowledge
            that actual travel conditions, availability, pricing, and options
            may differ from the Travel Content provided.
          </p>

          <h4>5. Payment and Subscription</h4>
          <p>
            Some features of TripWeaver require payment through a subscription
            plan or one-time purchases. By selecting a payment plan and
            providing payment information, you agree to pay the specified amount
            according to the terms displayed to you at the time of purchase. All
            payments are non-refundable unless otherwise specified or required
            by applicable law. If you choose a subscription plan, you authorize
            TripWeaver to charge your payment method on a recurring basis until
            you cancel. You may cancel your subscription at any time through
            your account settings. Cancellation will be effective at the end of
            your current billing period.
          </p>

          <h4>6. Limitations of Liability</h4>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall
            TripWeaver, its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers,
            or affiliates be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
            consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation,
            loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses,
            resulting from: (a) your access to or use of or inability to access
            or use the Services; (b) any conduct or content of any third party
            on the Services; (c) any content obtained from the Services; and (d)
            unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or
            content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including
            negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been
            informed of the possibility of such damage.

          <h4>8. Changes to Terms</h4>
          <p>
            TripWeaver reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time at
            our sole discretion. If we make material changes to these Terms, we
            will provide notice through the Services, or by other means, to
            provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become
            effective. Your continued use of the Services after the effective
            date of any changes constitutes your acceptance of the modified
            Terms.
          </p>

          <h4>9. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h4>
          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
            the laws of the jurisdiction in which TripWeaver operates, without
            regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any dispute arising from
            or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally
            settled by arbitration, using the English language, administered by
            the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer
            Arbitration Rules then in effect. The arbitration proceedings shall
            take place in the city where TripWeaver's headquarters are located,
            before one arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with AAA rules.
          </p>

          <h4>10. Termination</h4>
          <p>
            TripWeaver may terminate or suspend your account and access to the
            Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any
            reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the
            Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Services will
            immediately cease. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature
            should survive termination shall survive termination, including,
            without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers,
            indemnity, and limitations of liability.
          </p>

          <h4>11. User Conduct</h4>
          <p>
            You agree not to use the Services to: (a) violate any applicable law
            or regulation; (b) infringe the rights of any third party; (c)
            harass, abuse, or harm another person; (d) interfere with or disrupt
            the Services or servers or networks connected to the Services; (e)
            attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services; or (f) use the
            Services for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose.
          </p>

          <h4>12. Disclaimer of Warranties</h4>
          <p>
            The Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis
            without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied.
            TripWeaver disclaims all warranties, including but not limited to

          <h4>13. Geographic Restrictions</h4>
          <p>
            TripWeaver makes no representation that the Services are appropriate
            or available for use in all locations. Accessing the Services from
            territories where its contents are illegal or unlawful is
            prohibited. If you choose to access the Services from locations
            outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and are
            responsible for compliance with local laws.
          </p>

          <h4>14. Entire Agreement</h4>
          <p>
            These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal
            notices published by TripWeaver on the Services, shall constitute
            the entire agreement between you and TripWeaver concerning the
            Services. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a
            court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision
            shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these
            Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.
          </p>
